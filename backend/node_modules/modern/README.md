## Configuration

If you'd like to override any of the design system predefined defaults such as colors or the font family, simply import the design system configuration object and override the properties you'd like to customize.

```html
import { config } from 'modern'

config.fonts.family = 'Gotham'
config.colors.blue.blue900 = '#3287f1'
```
